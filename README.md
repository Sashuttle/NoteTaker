# NoteTaker
Challenge 11 of Bootcamp is where I am to create an application called Note Taker. It will be used to write and save notes. It will use express.js back end. It will also save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The front end has already been created and I will be created the back end. Both front and back end will be connected by me and I will deploy it to render.
